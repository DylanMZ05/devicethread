        </strong>You and devicethread® agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitral or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.

The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or the applicable AAA Rules, discovery in the arbitration shall be limited to one set of interrogatories, one set of requests for admissions, and one set of requests for production of documents.The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. You agree that the party that prevails in arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. </li>
      <li class="list-item-6"><strong>Rules of AAA</strong><br>
        The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules" class="text-highlight">https://www.adr.org/Rules</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

      <p class="paragraph-10">This Agreement along with our <a href="privacy-policy.html" class="text-highlight">Privacy Policy</a> constitutes the entire agreement between you and devicethread® and supersedes any prior agreements between you and devicethread® with respect to the subject matter herein.

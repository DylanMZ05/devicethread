      <p><strong>22. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</strong></p>
      <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH DEVICETHREAD® INC. AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
      <ol role="list">
        <li>Binding Arbitration<br>
          Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and DeviceThread® agree (a) to waive your and DeviceThread®’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement, access to our website or App, resolved in a court, and (b) to waive your and DeviceThread®’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and DeviceThread® agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or a jury in court).</li>
        <li>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions<br>
          You and DeviceThread® agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or use or access of our website or App is personal to you and DeviceThread® and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and DeviceThread® agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and DeviceThread® agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</li>
        <li>Federal Arbitration Act<br>
          You and DeviceThread® agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</li>
        <li>Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution<br>
          You and DeviceThread® agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitral or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to DeviceThread® shall be sent by certified mail or courier to DeviceThread® Inc., Attn: Narayanan Karuvapatantha, 3308 Preston Road Suite 350230, Plano TX 75093 . Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the <a href="mailto:support@devicethread.com" class="text-highlight">support@devicethread.com</a> you use or used for your DeviceThread® account and, if different, an <a href="mailto:support@devicethread.com" class="text-highlight">support@devicethread.com</a> at which you can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent electronically in accordance with this Agreement and will include (x) our name, postal address, telephone number and an <a href="mailto:support@devicethread.com" class="text-highlight">support@devicethread.com</a> at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and DeviceThread® cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or DeviceThread® may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section, commence an arbitration proceeding.</li>
        <li>Process<br>
          EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES IN WHICH EITHER PARTY SEEKS TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR SEEKS INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR THE ALLEGED UNLAWFUL USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, LOGOS, TRADE SECRETS OR PATENTS, YOU AND DEVICETHREAD® INC. AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE MUST BE COMMENCED OR FILED BY YOU OR DEVICETHREAD® INC. WITHIN (1) YEAR OF THE DATE THE DISPUTE AROSE, OTHERWISE THE UNDERLYING CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED (WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND DEVICETHREAD® INC. WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT SUCH CLAIM REGARDING THE DISPUTE). You and DeviceThread® agree that &nbsp;(a) any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of California, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</li>
        <li>Authority of Arbitrator<br>
          As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitral, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or the applicable AAA Rules, discovery in the arbitration shall be limited to one set of interrogatories, one set of requests for admissions, and one set of requests for production of documents.<br>
          <br>
          The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. You agree that the party that prevails in arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.</li>
        <li>Rules of AAA<br>
          The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules" class="text-highlight">https://www.adr.org/Rules</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of AAA, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of AAA and any claim that the rules of AAA are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</li>
        <li>Severability<br>
          If any term, clause or provision of this Section is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth herein are severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.</li>
        <li>Opt-Out Right<br>
          YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION BY WRITING TO: DEVICETHREAD® INC., RE: OPT-OUT, 3308 PRESTON ROAD SUITE 350230, PLANO TX 75093. IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE OPT OUT NOTICE MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND CLEARLY INDICATE YOUR INTENT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION. BY OPTING OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU ARE AGREEING TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 22.</li>

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to access to our website or App or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
